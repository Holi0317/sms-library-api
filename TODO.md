# Future Plans

Just a todo list that remind me to do these things

 - [ ] Tidy up diretory. 
 - [ ] Change diretory name to slh(Sms-Library-Helper)
 - [ ] Setup setup.py and add ez\_install
 - [ ] Add django support to web. In fact, I have to learn html and JS and all the crazy things for this
 - [ ] Add Google+ login to the web. Users have to add account with their google+ and bind it to library system.
 - [ ] Using the login and access calander API. And you get this
