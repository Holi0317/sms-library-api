# Future Plans

Just a todo list that remind me to do these things

 - [ ] Add flask support to web. In fact, I have to learn html and JS and all the crazy things for this
 - [ ] Add Google+ login to the web. Users have to add account with their google+ and bind it to library system.
 - [ ] Using the login and access calander API. And you get this
 - [ ] Use Django to send email to user if user need to return the book manually. This will exist with calander.
